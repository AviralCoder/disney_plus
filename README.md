## Try it out

This is a React app and has been deployed to Vercel. To try it out by downloading it, follow these steps -

-   Install Yarn or Node
-   Download the repo
-   Open your command line or terminal and run `cd <the path of the repo on your computer>`
-   Run `yarn start` if you donwloaded Yarn and `npm start` if you downloadede Node. **Please don't open the index.html directly. You will see a blank page. To see the project, you need to run the commands**
-   Your default browser will open on the port `localhost:3000` and you will be able to see the react app.
-   For debugging components install the _React Dev Tools_ extension and inspect the webpage. You will be able to see the _Components_ tab. Click on it and you can debug the application

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
